Exploratory Data Analysis Project1

Below a brief explanation on the setting needed in your PC to run the programs for the project1
of the exploratory data analysis course, part of the Johns Hopkins coursera data science specialization.

Create and set "C:/Exploratory Project" as working directory

Download the dataset in the previous working directory, making sure the name of the dataset is household_power_consumption.txt

Put the four .R files (ie. Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R, Plot4.R) in the previous directory

When running every single .R file you are getting the four .png files (ie. plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png)
